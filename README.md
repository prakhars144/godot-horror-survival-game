# godot-horror-survival-game

> My first game to learn godot and general 3D game dev

The project is based on FinePointCGI youtube course **[Creating a Horror Game With Godot 4](https://www.youtube.com/@FinePointCGI)**. I'll fix the bugs and update the course as per latest Godot 4 version. I'll also keep on making changes to improve the code base and make a complete finished game out of this project.

## Timelines:
September 2023: Basic mechanism completion
November 2023: Adding assets for enemies and players.
February 2024: Making a short horror game from all the prototypes and mechanisms that are already implemented
